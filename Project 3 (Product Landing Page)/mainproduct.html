                    <h2>Sarangi</h2>
                    <p>The Sarangi (Nepali/Hindi: सारङ्गी) is a folk Nepalese string instrument. Unlike Classical Indian Sarangi, <br> 
                      it has four strings and all of them are played. Traditionally, in Nepal, Sarangi was only played by people <br> 
                      of Gandarva or Gaine cast, who sings narrative tales and folk song. However, in present days, its widely <br>
                      used and played by many.</p> <br>
                      <p>Traditional Nepali Sarangi is made up of single piece of wood having a neck and hollowed out body.Sarangi <br>
                         is carved out from a very light wood, locally known as Khiro. The body is carved into a hollow frame with<br>
                         two openings. The lower opening is then covered up with dried sheep-skin. 
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        The original strings were made out of sheep intestine, similar to the use of catgut (made from the intestines  <br>
                        of cattle) in violins.The village people allotted intestines of sheep, sacrificed during major festivals like  <br>
                        Dasain, to the Gandarvas. The Gandarvas left the intestine in a pot for some days. Once the meat was fully  <br>
                        rotten, it was pulled out, leaving behind the fine nerves of the intestine which were then woven to get the strings, <br>
                        which produced fine quality sound.
                    </p> <br>
                    <p>
                        It is available in various size. Sarangi has four strings and played with the help of a bow. Horse-tail hair, which is <br>
                        still used by violin players, was originally used for the bow string of the Sarangi but these days nylon strings are <br>
                        ommon. The strings are supported by two bridges and tuned by Kunti (tuner). The Sarangi’s neck is fretless and the bridge <br>
                        is seated on a skin stretched over the body of the instrument. Different notes are made by touching the strings with the <br>
                        nail of fingers of the left hand. Notes in traditional sarangi strats from G4 and almost covers two octaves. Traditionally, <br>
                        sarangi is tuned as G4 C5 C5 G5 or Pa Sa Sa Pa.
